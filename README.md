# Homeauto_TUI

A basic TUI with the bubbletea/lipgloss libraries.

## Purpose:
I've got a raspberry pi and a display, I've had pis since 2013, somehow never connected a touch screen to one.

I was originally going to work on a reactive frontend for my server, but decided this would be more fun, a crisp
text UI with basic mouse capabilities to throw on the display, and eventually embed into a shelf speaker cabinet on my desk
to provide certain info at a glance. 

It's also an opportunity to write some more go.
